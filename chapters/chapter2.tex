\chapter{Analysis and Specification of Requirements}

\section*{Introduction}
This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis and specification of requirements for the MindCare-IA platform, a sophisticated Django-based mental health application designed to facilitate interaction between therapists and patients. The meticulous identification and documentation of both functional and non-functional requirements are pivotal to ensuring the final system effectively addresses the complex needs of mental healthcare delivery while meeting stakeholders' expectations.

The requirements engineering process employed multiple methodologies to gather complete and accurate specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain Analysis:} Examination of existing mental health platforms and healthcare systems to identify industry standards and best practices
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder Interviews:} Structured consultations with mental health professionals and potential users to capture diverse perspectives
    \item \textbf{Technical Feasibility Assessment:} Evaluation of modern technologies including Django's capabilities for implementing secure and scalable solutions
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance Research:} Investigation of healthcare data protection regulations and privacy standards
\end{itemize}

MindCare-IA aims to revolutionize mental healthcare delivery through a feature-rich platform integrating secure messaging, appointment scheduling, therapy session management, mood tracking, and therapeutic interventions. The system architecture leverages Django's robust framework to implement microservices for user management, real-time communication, notification delivery, and data analytics while maintaining strict security protocols.

The requirements documented in this chapter serve three essential purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide a clear roadmap for the development team to implement features and functionalities
    \item Establish measurable criteria for system validation and acceptance testing
    \item Create a shared understanding among stakeholders about the scope and capabilities of the final system
\end{enumerate}

\section{Analysis and Specification of Functional Requirements}
Functional requirements describe what the system should do, specifying the features and functionalities that must be implemented. These requirements define the core capabilities of the system and outline the behaviors it should exhibit under specific conditions.

\subsection{Identification of Actors}
This section identifies the primary actors who interact with the MindCare-IA system. An actor represents a role that a user or external system plays when interacting with the application.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Actor} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Patient & End user seeking mental health support. Patients can schedule appointments, communicate with therapists, track their mood, maintain a personal journal, and interact with the AI chatbot. \\
\hline
Therapist & Mental health professional providing care. Therapists manage patient relationships, conduct therapy sessions, view patient mood data, maintain session notes, and manage their availability calendar. \\
\hline
System Administrator & Technical user responsible for system maintenance, therapist verification, and platform configuration. \\
\hline
AI Chatbot & Autonomous component providing immediate mental health support through natural language processing capabilities. \\
\hline
External Authentication Provider & Third-party identity provider (Google) that handles user authentication via OAuth 2.0. \\
\hline
Notification System & Internal component responsible for delivering real-time messages and alerts to users across different channels (in-app, email). \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Primary Actors in the MindCare-IA System}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Actor Relationships and Interactions}
The following describes the key relationships between different actors and how they interact with the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Patient-Therapist Relationship:} A core relationship where patients connect with therapists for mental health services. This is facilitated through messaging, appointments, and mood tracking features.
    
    \item \textbf{Patient-Chatbot Interaction:} Supplementary support mechanism where patients can receive immediate assistance from an AI-powered system when human therapists are unavailable.
    
    \item \textbf{Therapist-Administrator Interaction:} Administrative workflow where therapists submit credentials for verification and administrators validate them to ensure professional standards.
    
    \item \textbf{System-User Notification:} System-initiated communication to keep users informed of relevant events, such as new messages, appointment reminders, or status updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expression of Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements of the MindCare-IA platform have been systematically organized according to the primary system modules identified during the domain analysis. Each requirement follows the format: "The system shall [capability]" to ensure clarity and testability.

\textbf{Description:} This use case outlines the process for validating therapist credentials to ensure platform integrity and patient safety.

\textbf{Primary Actors:} Therapist, System Administrator

\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Therapist has registered with professional details
    \item Required verification documents are available
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Main Flow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Therapist submits license information and uploads verification documents
    \item System securely stores documents and creates verification case
    \item Administrator reviews submitted credentials and documentation
    \item Administrator validates license information against official databases
    \item Administrator approves or rejects verification
    \item System updates therapist profile status accordingly
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Alternative Flows:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If documentation is incomplete, system requests additional information
    \item If verification fails, administrator provides reason and therapist may resubmit
    \item If license expires, system flags profile for re-verification
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Postconditions:} Therapist receives verified status allowing patient interaction, or is notified of rejection with reason
