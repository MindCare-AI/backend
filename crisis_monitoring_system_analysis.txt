# Crisis Monitoring System - Complete Implementation Analysis

## Overview

The Crisis Monitoring System in the MindCare platform is a comprehensive safety mechanism designed to detect, assess, and respond to mental health crisis situations in real-time. The system employs advanced NLP techniques, confidence scoring, and multi-level response protocols to ensure user safety while minimizing false positives.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Detection Engine (Chatbot Service)

**Location**: `/chatbot/services/chatbot_service.py`

The primary crisis detection is implemented in the `ChatbotService` class through the `_enhanced_crisis_detection()` method:

#### Detection Methodology:
- **Pattern-Based Recognition**: Uses regex patterns with weighted confidence scores
- **Category Classification**: Classifies crises into suicide, self-harm, and immediate danger
- **Confidence Scoring**: Implements threshold-based assessment (min 0.6)
- **Context Analysis**: Reduces false positives through contextual understanding

#### Pattern Categories:
1. **Suicide Patterns** (0.85-0.95 confidence):
   - Direct statements: "kill myself", "want to die", "end my life"
   - Ideation: "thinking about suicide", "no reason to live"
   - Specific phrases: "stop thinking about killing myself"

2. **Self-Harm Patterns** (0.8-0.9 confidence):
   - Actions: "cutting myself", "harm myself", "hurt myself"
   - Intent: "injure myself"

3. **Immediate Danger Patterns** (0.7-0.95 confidence):
   - Urgency: "help me now", "emergency", "crisis"
   - Planning: "have a plan", "plan to kill"

#### False Positive Reduction:
- **Quote Detection**: Reduces confidence by 30% for quoted text
- **Educational Context**: Reduces confidence by 40% for help-seeking language
- **Third-Person References**: Identifies when users discuss others' situations

### 2. Crisis Event Logging (AI Engine)

**Location**: `/AI_engine/services/crisis_monitoring.py`

The `CrisisMonitoringService` manages crisis event persistence and response coordination:

#### Core Functions:
- **Event Logging**: Records crisis events with metadata
- **Risk Level Assessment**: Categorizes based on confidence thresholds
- **Response Triggering**: Initiates immediate response for high-risk situations

#### Risk Level Thresholds:
- **Low**: 0.6-0.74 confidence
- **Medium**: 0.75-0.84 confidence  
- **High**: 0.85-0.94 confidence
- **Critical**: 0.95+ confidence

#### Data Model (CrisisEvent):
```python
class CrisisEvent(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey("users.CustomUser")
    message_content = models.TextField()  # Truncated to 500 chars
    confidence = models.FloatField()
    crisis_level = models.CharField(choices=CRISIS_LEVELS)
    matched_terms = models.JSONField()
    category = models.CharField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    resolved = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    resolution_notes = models.TextField()
    staff_notified = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    follow_up_required = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

### 3. Real-Time Analytics Integration

**Location**: `/datawarehouse/services/realtime_analytics.py`

The real-time analytics service processes crisis events for monitoring and reporting:

#### Capabilities:
- **Stream Processing**: Handles crisis events through event streams
- **Alert Broadcasting**: Sends crisis alerts to response teams via WebSocket
- **Metrics Tracking**: Maintains crisis detection statistics
- **Audit Logging**: Creates comprehensive audit trails

#### WebSocket Integration:
```python
await self.channel_layer.group_send(
    "crisis_team",
    {
        "type": "crisis_alert",
        "user_id": event.user_id,
        "event_data": event.data,
        "timestamp": event.timestamp.isoformat(),
        "priority": "critical"
    }
)
```

### 4. Notification and Escalation System

**Location**: `/notifications/services/`

#### Multi-Level Notification Strategy:
1. **Immediate Alerts**: Critical-priority notifications to crisis response team
2. **Staff Notifications**: Alerts to mental health professionals
3. **Email Escalation**: Backup notification delivery
4. **SMS Integration**: Emergency contact protocols

#### Notification Metadata:
- User identification
- Crisis confidence level
- Message preview (truncated)
- Timestamp and category
- Response team assignments
