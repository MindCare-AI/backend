### 2. AI/ML Techniques and Algorithms

#### Content-Based Filtering
**Implementation**: TF-IDF Vectorization with Cosine Similarity
- **Topic Extraction**: SpaCy NLP pipeline extracts topics from post content
- **Content Vectorization**: Posts converted to TF-IDF vectors based on content, topics, and therapeutic keywords
- **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity between user preferences and content vectors
- **Therapeutic Content Matching**: KNN algorithm matches content to treatment goals

```python
# Conceptual workflow from codebase analysis:
def content_based_filtering(user_profile, available_content):
    # Extract topics using SpaCy NLP
    user_topics = extract_topics_with_spacy(user_profile.interaction_history)
    
    # Create TF-IDF vectors for content
    content_vectors = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(available_content)
    user_vector = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(user_topics)
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(user_vector, content_vectors)
    
    # Apply therapeutic content prioritization
    therapeutic_scores = apply_therapeutic_matching(content, user_goals)
    
    return combine_scores(similarity_scores, therapeutic_scores)
```

#### Mood-Based Content Suggestion
**Implementation**: RoBERTa Emotion Detection with Sentiment-Mood Correlation
- **Emotion Detection**: RoBERTa model analyzes current user mood state
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced sentiment classification of content
- **Mood-Content Correlation**: Statistical correlation between mood states and content engagement
- **Adaptive Suggestions**: Content selection based on current emotional needs

```python
# Mood-based recommendation workflow:
def mood_based_recommendations(user_current_mood, content_pool):
    # Detect emotions using RoBERTa
    emotion_profile = roberta_emotion_detection(user_current_mood)
    
    # Analyze content sentiment
    content_sentiments = analyze_content_sentiment(content_pool)
    
    # Calculate mood-content correlation coefficient
    correlation_scores = calculate_mood_correlation(emotion_profile, content_sentiments)
    
    # Select therapeutic content matching mood needs
    return select_therapeutic_content(correlation_scores, user_therapeutic_goals)
```

#### Collaborative Filtering

```python
# From SocialInteractionAnalysisService:
def analyze_social_network(interaction_data):
    # Track user interactions
    user_interactions = {
        "comments_to": count_comments_given,
        "comments_from": count_comments_received,
        "likes_to": count_likes_given,
        "likes_from": count_likes_received
    }
    
    # Calculate relationship strength
    relationship_scores = calculate_interaction_scores(user_interactions)
    
    # Identify key relationships and support network
    support_network = identify_support_connections(relationship_scores)
    
    return {
        "network_density": calculate_network_density(),
        "mutual_connections": count_mutual_interactions(),
        "relationship_strength": average_relationship_strength(),
