## Usage Instructions

1. **Rendering**: Use any PlantUML renderer (online, IDE plugin, or standalone)
2. **Individual Focus**: Each diagram can be rendered separately for specific workflow analysis
3. **Combined View**: All diagrams together provide complete system interaction overview
4. **Documentation**: Use alongside the use case diagram (`global_use_case_diagram_plantuml.puml`) for comprehensive system understanding

## Technical Notes

- Diagrams use PlantUML's `!theme plain` for clean, professional rendering
- Consistent participant styling across all diagrams
- Parallel processing notation (`par`/`end`) shows concurrent operations
- Alternative flows (`alt`/`else`/`end`) demonstrate conditional logic
- Loop constructs show iterative processes

These sequence diagrams complement the comprehensive use case diagram by showing the temporal aspects and detailed interaction flows of the MindCare-IA platform's core functionalities.
